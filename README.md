# nosql-challenge
To run this code you will want to run the NoSQL_setup first and then you can run the NoSQL_analysis.  
The setup file is used for initial investigation into the data, and changing up some field data, and deleting some documents that are not needed by the magazine. 
The analysis file is used for digging a little deeper into the data and answering questions and turning each list of establisments into dataframes.
